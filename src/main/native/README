libmatthew-java v0.1
--------------------

These are a selection of libraries for Java which I have written because they
are useful and not provided with normal Java. They are available for download
here and are licensed under the GPL or LGPL. They all come with example
applications using the libraries. 

The ones I consider distribution-worthy are packaged up together. Several other
classes are available separately below. 

Unix Sockets Library

This is a collection of classes and native code to allow you to read and write
Unix sockets in Java.
